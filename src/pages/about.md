title: About the Pianolatron
---

The Pianolatron is the result of a large-scale collaborative partnership between faculty investigators, students and staff affiliated with the Stanford University Department of Music and the Stanford University Libraries' [Player Piano Program](https://library.stanford.edu/projects/player-piano-program). The technical implementation of the Pianolatron app, carried out by the developer team of the Stanford Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Research (CIDR), benefited greatly from contributions by other project participants and members of the international player piano and open source software communities.
