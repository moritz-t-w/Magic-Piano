# Controlling the Pianolatron

In the basic "Listen" mode, the Pianolatron can only be controlled via the transport control buttons (play/pause, rewind, loop) and tempo slider at the top of the player, which can be accessed via a pointer device or keyboard navigation.

In the more advanced "Perform" mode, it is possible to modify many aspects of the playback of a piano roll interactively, including bass and treble volume, pedaling, accents, and transposition, as well as recording and all features available in "Listen" mode. In addition to the on-screen transport strip buttons, the app supports control of these features via mapped keyboard buttons, a gamepad controller, and a MIDI input device.

## Game controller button mappings

In "Perform" mode, the Pianolatron supports interactive modification of many playback parameters via a gamepad controller that is connected to the computer wirelessly or via USB. Information about recognized controllers (if any) and adjustible sensitivity settings are available at the bottom of the Advanced Settings menu.

Please note that the mappings in the image below may not be available and consistent for all combinations of game controller, browser and operating system.
